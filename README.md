# Etch-a-Sketch
A project based on the game Etch-a-Sketch, which is a mechanical game that allows drawings to be created through a nub or needle controlled by two knobs.

This project while based on the Etch-a-Sketch game is slightly different. Squares arranged in a grid will be colored as the user's mouse hovers over them, changing colors randomly each time the user's cursor passes them.

The project aims to display the ability to create a project using html, css, and javascript in conjunction with particular focus on DOM manipulation.
